# configure network settings with Ansible system roles

Before doing any operation, confirm that the NetworkManager service is started and enabled on your managed node. Do this using a playbook. For this task, use the service module in the service.yml file.

---
- name: playbook for starting and enabling the NetworkManager
  hosts: server1.example.com
  tasks:
  -    Name: start the service
       service:
         name: NetworkManager
         state: started
         enabled: true

If the playbook runs successfully without any errors, the service is started and enabled on the managed node machine.

Now write a playbook to add a new connection on the managed node:

---
- name: playbook for configuring second interface
  hosts: server1.example.com
  vars:
     target_mac: “52:54:00:fe:2f:b8”
     network_connection:
          -  name: static-network
             type: ethernet
             mac: “{{ target_mac }}”
             state: up
             ip :
               dhcp: no
               address:
                    -  192.168.0.5/24
  roles:
   -    rhel-system-roles.network

This playbook will configure a static-network connection with a static IP address.

To check the settings, log in to server1.example.com and confirm the newly-added connection:

$ nmcli connection show
