# Site deployment

The playbooks deploy Apache, PHP, MySQL, Nagios, and HAProxy to a CentOS-based set of servers.

This is our site-wide deployment playbook. It can be used to initially deploy the site, as well as push updates to all of the servers:

# here, the 'base-apache' role which simply sets up Apache, and 'web'
# which includes our example web application.
